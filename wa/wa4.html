<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I am from a small Colorado mountain town, Durango. I grew up outside, spending the summers on rafting trips on the San Juan and winters skiing at Purgatory Resort, and any time in-between was spent playing the piano, reading, doing art, and playing with my brother.</p>
<p>During my time in school from K-12, I excelled in my classes, earning Honor Roll each year and taking AP and concurrent enrollment courses at Fort Lewis College my senior year. I took piano lessons for 12 years, and participated in Cross Country and golf.</p>
<p>Now, I am enrolled at CU Boulder with plans to attend law school in the future. I have a passion for learning that I hope never goes away, and I am excited to see what else I am able to participate in.</p>
